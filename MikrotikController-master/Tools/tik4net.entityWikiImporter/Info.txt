Main goal of this helper application is support for semi-automatic creating tik entities (C# source code generator)
from official mikrotik wiki.

Just start application, fill wiki page url, parse it (you can manually fill html of property tables (<table> ... </table>) into textboxes if parser does not work properly) and generate source.

Remarks: this application uses HtmlAgility pack (as nuGet package).

Enjoy,
D
